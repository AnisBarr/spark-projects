# spark-class-timeusage

Weekly assignment for Scala Spark class analyzing weekly time usage data

Assignment follows the Coursera Course: Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark: https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data/home/welcome

## Summary

This assignment takes the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/bls/american-time-use-survey and seeks to analyze 
information about people's time spent. The goal is to identify three groups of activities:

* Primary Needs (sleeping and eating)
* Work
* Other (Leisure)

This project will use Dataframes and Datasets instead of the lower-level RDD API.

The following questions need to be answered (taken from the assignment):

1. How much time do we spend on primary needs compared to other activities?
2. Do women and men spend the same amount of time in working?
3. Does the time spent on primary needs change when people get older?
4. How much time do employed people spend on leisure compared to unemployed people?

## Todo

Step through the same analysis using Python instead of Scala.
